# Password Manager
## Overview
Hello everyone! I'm Mert, and today is Day 29 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. In this project, I've developed a Password Manager using Tkinter for the user interface and a custom Password Generator.

## Project Description
The Password Manager provides a simple and secure way to manage and generate passwords for various websites. It allows users to save their website, email, and password information securely and generate strong passwords using the built-in Password Generator.

## Password Generator
The Password Generator uses a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols to create strong and secure passwords. It ensures that the generated passwords meet the recommended criteria for strength.

## How to Run
To use the Password Manager, follow these steps:

* Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
![password_manager](password_manager.png)

* Fill in the required information for the website, email, and password.

* Click the "Generate Password" button to create a strong and random password.

* Click the "Add" button to save the entered details securely.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Project Files
* main.py: The main Python script for the Password Manager.
* password_generator.py: The module containing the Password Generator function.
## Getting Started
* Run the script and fill in the necessary information.
* Use the "Generate Password" button to create strong passwords.
* To securely save the entered details, click on the 'Add' button. The saved data will be stored in a file named 'data.txt'.
# Used Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in this project:

* Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
* random: For generating random characters for the Password Generator.
* messagebox (from tkinter): For displaying alerts and messages.
* pyperclip: For copying the generated password to the clipboard.
## Educational Insights
This project provides hands-on experience with key Python concepts:

* Tkinter GUI: Creating a graphical user interface for easy interaction.
* Function Implementation: Defining functions to perform specific tasks.
* Password Generation: Implementing a custom Password Generator.
* File Handling: Saving and retrieving information from a text file securely.
## Conclusion
I hope you find the Password Manager and Password Generator helpful for managing your credentials securely! It's been a great journey reaching Day 29, and I'm excited to continue exploring and learning. Happy coding!
